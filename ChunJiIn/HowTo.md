# How to compile

First of all, you need to install "libsd2-dev" with "$ sudo apt install libsd2-dev" command.
And you also need "cmake" and "build-essential packages."
## Pre-requisite
1. Run "$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake"

## Build step
1. Go to "Source" directory.
2. Run "$ mkdir build" and "$ cd build"
3. Run "$ cmake .."
4. Run "$ make"

After those commands, you can see "lvgl_main" executable file. 
Run it.
