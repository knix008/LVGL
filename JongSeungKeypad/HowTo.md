# How to compile

First of all, you need to install "libsd2-dev" with "$ sudo apt install libsd2-dev" command.
And you also need "cmake" and "build-essential packages."
## Pre-requisite
1. Run "$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake libfreetype6-dev libopenssl-dev"
2. Go to Source directory and run "build_sqlcipher.sh".

## Build step
1. Run "$ mkdir build" and "$ cd build"
2. Run "$ cmake .."
3. Run "$ make"

After those commands, you can see "lvgl_main" executable file. 
Run it.
